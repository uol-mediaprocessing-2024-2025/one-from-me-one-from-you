Current functionality:
- Seperate the shape on a given 2d image (static/collage_output.jpg) from the background.
- Add white squares to the image, which serve as placedholders for images to be placed in.
- The image with white squares(static/background.png) is displayed on a web server(app.py), where images can be placed on the white squares.
